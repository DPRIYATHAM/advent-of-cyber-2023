# Chatbot, tell me, if you're really safe?

McHoneyBell - leader of the "Audit and Vulnerabilities" team, or the "B Team". <br>
Check if the internal chatbot created by AntarctiCrafts meets Best Festival Company's security standards.
**Prompt Injection**, a vulnerability that affects insecure chatbots powered by natural language processing (NLP).

### Prompt Injection (assumption)
You might assume that a simple solution to avoid this kind of attack and potential leaks is to remove all sensitive information from the training data. While this might indeed be a valid solution, the reality is a bit more complicated.<br>
Retraining a model, particularly post-deployment, is rarely feasible. Moreover, the nature of information isn't static; what may be deemed harmless today could become sensitive tomorrow due to evolving circumstances.<br>
In these situations, it's important to protect against such vulnerabilities by adding security measures.

### AI-Assisted Security Measures

There are countless ways to exploit a chatbot, so how can developers keep up and cover all possible attacks? As humans, we can't. But another AI can!<br>
The idea is to set up another AI to intercept user messages and check for malicious input before sending them to the chatbot. This other AI (let's refer to it as the "Interceptor") can be continuously trained on malicious inputs. The more people use and attack it, the smarter it becomes and the better it can detect malicious input.<br>
This, combined with a properly constructed system prompt, would increase the security of the chatbot.<br>
But this doesn't mean that it's 100% foolproof, of course. Clever ways to fool the Interceptor may arise, especially with novel attacks it hasn't encountered before. Poking around a system long enough could unveil intricacies and loopholes to exploit.

This shows that security challenges can be very specific; what works on one system may not work on another because they are set up differently.
